# üì¶ Network Payload v1.0.0
Obtain Wi-Fi names and passwords from a Microsoft Windows operating system computer. This can be accessed by leveraging the convenience of Wi-Fi profiles that are saved on Microsoft Windows operating systems using PowerShell. The payload was designed with the classic Rubber Ducky Scripting Language 1.0 for a Flipper Zero.

# ‚õî Prevention
There are many ways to prevent this hotload attack from occurring. A very quick, simple, and temporary way is by deleting "Managed Known Networks" in Settings and to refrain from saving your Wi-Fi passwords.
